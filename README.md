# MFCC-Speech-Commands-Recognize-
1. Speech Commands Recognize Based On MFCC Features 


2. You can downlaod Google speech commands dataset from "http://download.tensorflow.org/data/speech_commands_v0.01.tar.gz"  


3. I olny use four commands "no","off","on","yes". Let's call them 0, 1, 2, 3  


4. Your Tensorflow version must than 2.0. Using TFRecord file for train datas.  


5. It's only a simple example for speech commands recognize based on MFCC, using a cnn model. INT8 quantized.  


6. If you have some question, you can contact with me. WeChat:xuelei_jian  


7. TODO: Covert the model and inference it on the Cotex-M microcontroller.    


8. Your star is the best encouragement for me.
